# Snoozey-Alarm

Alarm created in Computer Topics, second semester senior year 2018.


2/6/18 
  Learned about Date Class, DateFormatter Class.
  Converted timeAlarmWillSound to a member of Date Class and used 
  DateFormatter to get only the time with "AM" or "PM" to properly display to the UI
  
2/15/18 
  Learned how to use a UI view to present a view inside a different view so I could have a table view in my add edit alarm VC
  Added Start Screen
  Worked on Segues 
  Connected outlets on Wake Up Vc 
  Created alarmFeaturesTableController and embedded in UI View in Add Edit Alarm VC
  Currently getting SIGBORT when I push to AddEdit, I've cleaned up some outlets and segues in Alarm View and 
  add edit alarm      View, Think it must be in the new TableView I created
